Vivillon's pattern depends on the real-world geographical region set in its original trainer's 3DS, and cannot be changed.\n\nTrading a Scatterbug, Spewpa, or egg does not affect the pattern it will have as a Vivillon.  Changing the 3DS's region setting will not affect the game's Vivillon pattern until the player starts a new game.\n\nThe Fancy and Poké Ball Patterns do not correspond to any region and are only available through distributions.","stats":{"hp":{"value":80,"effort":1},"attack":{"value":52,"effort":0},"defense":{"value":50,"effort":0},"special-attack":{"value":90,"effort":1},"special-defense":{"value":50,"effort":0},"speed":{"value":89,"effort":1}}}
