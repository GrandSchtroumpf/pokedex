Moves are retained through form changes.  Shaymin transforms into Sky Forme with the use of a gracidea.  It is limited to Land Forme at night, when frozen, and in the storage system boxes; under these conditions, Sky Shaymin reverts to Land Forme, and the Gracidea has no effect.  The Gracidea must be used again to return to Sky Forme.\n\nIn Generation IV, Shaymin is also limited to Land Forme in the Wi-Fi Club and the Union Room.\n\nA Gracidea may be received by showing a Shaymin met in a fateful encounter to a certain NPC, depending on the game:\n\n* Platinum: A woman in southwest floaroma town.\n* HeartGold and SoulSilver: The owner of the goldenrod city flower shop.\n* Black and White: A woman in the lacunosa town Pokémon Center.\n* Black 2 and White 2: A woman in the striaton city Pokémon Center."},"evolution":[[{"pokemon":{"id":491,"imgName":"darkrai","name":"Darkrai","formName":"","shape":"Humanoid","color":{"l":0,"c":0,"h":0},"types":[{"id":"dark","name":"Dark","color":{"l":0.48,"c":0.03,"h":62}}],"genus":"Pitch-Black Pokémon","generation":"generation-iv","flavorText":"It can lull people to sleep and\nmake them dream.
